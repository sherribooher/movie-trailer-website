# Movie Website Project

Source code for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Movie Website Project

### What Is It and What Does It Do?
This project uses Python code to generate the HTML (from a template) required to create the customized website with movie instances. These instances contain the movie's title, poster art, trailer, storyline, and runtime. 

### Requirements

Python 2.x is required to run this project. The source code files are needed, and can be downloaded or cloned from Github. All source code files should be contained and kept in the same directory to ensure the code runs correctly.

### Project Repository Contents
 **media.py**:&nbsp;&nbsp;_This file's code creates the Movie class, initializes it, and creates the function to show the movie trailers_  
 
 **fresh_tomatoes.py**:&nbsp;&nbsp;_This file contains the function and the HTML template information that will be used to create the website from the movie instances_
 
 **entertainment_center.py**:&nbsp;&nbsp;_This is the main Python code that will be executed to produce and show the website in the browser_
 
### Directions for Obtaining and Executing the Code

Download or clone the movie-website-project directory from Github. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sherribooher/movie-trailer-website.git). &nbsp; _If you downloaded the .zip file, extract the directory and all files to your local computer._

Open the command line interface on your computer (_Terminal on MacOS and Linux, Command Prompt on Windows_).

From the command line, navigate to the project directory where the files were extracted and type in the following command:

```bash
python entertainment_center.py
```
You should now see the Movie Trailer Website in your default web browser. To view a movie's trailer, click on that movie's poster art. I have also added the movie storylines and runtimes to provide more information about each movie.
